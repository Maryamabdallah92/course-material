# Course
Write the name of the course here, e.g. Client-Server Communication.

# The problem
Describe the problem you're trying to solve. Examples:

## Example 1
I'm trying to compute and display the sum of 8 and 9 in JavaScript.

## Example 2
The lab instructions says I should first do that, then this, then [...], and then when I run the code I should be asked to enter my name, but I never get to enter my name.

# Failed attempt
Describe your failed attempt to solve your problem. Examples:

## Example 1
My JavaScript code looks like this:

```js
const sum = 5 + 9
alert(sum)
```

When I run the code in a web browser it displays the number 14 instead of the expected number 17.

## Example 2
I followed the instructions and ended up with the following code:

```js
const name = 'prompt("Enter your name")'
alert(name)
```

But when I run the code it never asks me to enter a name, as it should do according to the instructions.

# The question(s)
Write your questions (a list of sentences each ending with a question mark) you want answered here. The teacher (or a friendly student) will only answer the questions you write here, so think twice about them.

## Example 1
Why does it display the number 14 instead of the expected number 17?

## Example 2
Are the instructions wrong, or have I done something wrong? If I have done something wrong, what is it?
