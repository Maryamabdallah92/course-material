# Welcome!
This is a website that I ([Peter Larsson-Green](https://ju.se/en/personinfo.html?sign=LarPet)) use in my work at [Jönköping University](https://ju.se/en.html) where I teach in various courses involving programming. Here I upload course material students can take part of in their studies. If you're curious, feel free to look around at the various courses and lectures.
