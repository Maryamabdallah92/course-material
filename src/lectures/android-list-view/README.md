# Android ListView
It's very common for an application to display a list of items. But if there are many items in the list, how can we do that in a resource and speed efficient way? Android's solution to that was initially the `ListView`, which we'll take a closer look at in this lecture. Nowadays the Android support library also has a `RecyclerView` we can use to achieve similar functionality. That one is a bit more configurable, but also a bit harder to use
