# Android Broadcast Receivers
Every now and then Android broadcasts different type of intents with information, such as Internet connection availability, Bluetooth enabled/disabled, etc. Applications can register and listen for these broadcasts using broadcast receivers, and if they want they can even broadcast their own intents, which other applications can listen for.
