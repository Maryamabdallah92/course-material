# Client-side JavaScript & BOM
Web browsers can not only render HTML code styled with CSS, they can also execute JavaScript code. JavaScript is a really simple language that can only be used for computations, i.e. it doesn't contain any input/output functionality, but when our JavaScript code is executed by a web browser it will be executed in an environment where the web browser has added some extra goodies we can use. This environment is known as the [Browser Object Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Browser_Object_Model).
