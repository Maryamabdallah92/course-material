# AJAX
Traditionally, the only way to load new information on a webpage was by clicking on a link or submitting a form to tell the web browser to send a GET or a POST request to fetch and display a new webpage. But with *Asynchronous JavaScript And XML* we can use client-side JavaScript to tell the web browser to send an HTTP request to a server, and we can also use client-side JavaScript to receive and handle the HTTP response the web browser receives back. This way it's easier to create more interactive websites with better user experience.
