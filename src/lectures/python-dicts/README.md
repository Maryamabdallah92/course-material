# Python Dicts
A *dict* is a value in Python that stores multiple values. In that sense, a dict it is quite similar to a list. The main difference is that each value in a list gets an index (`0`, `1`, `2`, ...), but in a dict each value gets a key instead, such as `name`, `age`, etc. Let's take a closer look at dicts works in this lecture.
