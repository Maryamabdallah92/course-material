# Kotlin
Kotlin is a pretty new programming language invented by JetBrains and initially released 2011. JetBrains are the ones who have built IntelliJ IDEA, which is the IDE Android Studio in turn is built on. The popularity of Kotlin increased 2017 when Google started to support it in Android Studio for developing Android applications, and in 2019 when Google recommended Android developers to use Kotlin instead of Java.
