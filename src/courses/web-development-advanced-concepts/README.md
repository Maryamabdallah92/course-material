# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Web Development - Advanced Concepts*! This is a follow up course to [Web Development Fundamentals](../web-development-fundamentals/), so you are expected to already know how to create web applications storing resources in a database and the things you learned in that course. In this course you will learn how to create web applications as well, but they will be bigger and better by using things like a three-layered architecture, dependency injection, client-side JavaScript and Docker.

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year.
