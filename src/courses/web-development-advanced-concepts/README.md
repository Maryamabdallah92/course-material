# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Web Development - Advanced Concepts*! This is a follow up course to [Web Development Fundamentals](../web-development-fundamentals/), so you are expected to already know how to create web applications storing resources in a database and the things you learned in that course. In this course you will learn how to create web applications as well, but they will be bigger and better by using things like a three-layered architecture, dependency injection, client-side JavaScript and Docker.

This website will be used to host the course material, but you still need to join the course's Ping Pong event:

1. Go to [the event cataloge on Ping Pong](https://pingpong.hj.se/courseCatalog.do).
2. Find the event `Web Development - Advanced Concepts - TFWN19 - S20`.
3. Join ("Start") the event by providing the password `TFWN19S2003`.

Ping Pong will be used to keep track of your progress in the course, to distribute you among the lab session groups, to handle submissions of your laboratory work, etc. You should only need to use Ping Pong when you are instructed to do that on this website (e.g. when submitting your laboratory work). 

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year.
