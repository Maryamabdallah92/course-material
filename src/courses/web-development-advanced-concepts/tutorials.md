## Tutorial 2 (Docker + Layered Architecture)
Unzip <a href="static-files/tutorial-02/platform.zip">the source code for the platform</a> and then run the command `docker-compose up --build -V` to run it. You can also debug your web application by connecting to it in Visual Studio Code when you open the root folder of the platform as a workspace in Visual Studio Code. You might need to change the IP address `192.168.99.100` in `.vscode/launch.json` to `localhost` or the IP address of your docker machine.
