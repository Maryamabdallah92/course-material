navbarTitle: Introduction to Script Programming

# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Introduction to Script Programming*! In this course you'll learn how to create small programs in Python your computer can execute.

This website will be used to host the course material, but you still need to join the course's Ping Pong event:

1. Go to [the event cataloge on Ping Pong](https://pingpong.hj.se/courseCatalog.do).
2. Find the event `Introduction to Script Programming - TSPG17 - A19`.
3. Join ("Start") the event by providing the password `TSPG17A1943`.

Ping Pong will be used to keep track of your progress in the course, to distribute you among the lab session groups, to handle submissions of your lab work, etc. You should only need to use Ping Pong when you are instructed to do that on this website (e.g. when submitting your laboratory work). 

::: warning Two course codes!
This course is primarily given for two programs, and they have different codes for this course:

* The bachelor program *IT Infrastructure and Network Design* use the course code `TSPG17`.
* The master program *Sustainable Building Information Management* use the course code `TSTG17`.

At the moment, the only difference between these two are some of the problems that should be solved in the laboratory work, but these differences have been pointed out in the instructions for the laboratory work.

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year.
