### Information to students
Information about the **Project Work** can be found on the page [Project Instructions](./project-instructions). It's about a website you should create throughout the course.

**Written Examination** is a [Digital Exam](https://ju.se/student/en/digital-exam.html) in Inspera at the end of the course. You need to register for it in advance per the instructions at [https://ju.se/student/en/studies/examination.html](https://ju.se/student/en/studies/examination.html).

### Conditions for the examined elements
Conditions for the **Project Work** can be found on the page [Project Instructions](./project-instructions).

No aids allowed are allowed for the **Written Examination**. The computer you write the exam on may only be used to answer the questions on the exam, nothing else.

### Re-examination of this course
Re-examination for the **Written Examination** is offered in the re-exam periods in January and August.

Re-examination for the **Project Work** is offered in the re-exam periods in January and August. If you need to know a precise date and time in advance, contact the course coordinator. The project work will only be graded 3/U (U=fail) at re-examination.

If you haven't passed some examination tests after the three examination opportunities (ordinary + 2 re-exam) you need to re-take those tests the next time the course run. Note that the instructions for those tests might have changed the next time the course run.

## Grading criteria
To receive a final grade on the course you need to pass both examination tests (Laboratory Work + Written Examination). The final grade will be based on the grade from the Written Examination. 

## Course Literature and Other Teaching Aids
* [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python](https://runestone.academy/runestone/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) by Allen Downey, Jeffrey Elkner and Chris Meyers

::: warning Note!
The link above leads to a free online version of the book with an interactive tool you can use to execute and debug Python code. We recommend you to use this online book, but if you prefer to read a physical book it's possible to buy that as well, but then it won't be the *Interactive Edition*.
