# Welcome!
Welcome to the course *Web Development Fundamentals*! In this course you'll learn how to create websites consisting of webpages generated by web applications running on the Internet and that are part of the web. Users can then visit your websites using a web browser.

::: danger Corona restrictions
Since this course is expected to have more than 50 students, having the lectures at campus is not allowed according to the school's policies. Lectures have been recorded in advance and are available on this website. Lab sessions will be given at campus as usual (there's only 20 students attending each lab session).

::: warning Note to old students
If you're an old student that took this course a previous year but still have some examination tests left to pass you take those tests as they are described this year. The old Ping Pong event won't be used any more, so join this year's Canvas Course, so we can keep track of your progress in the course this year there. If you aren't registered for the course this year, ask the course manager to invite you to the Canvas Course by sending him an email message based on the template in <FigureNumber /> below with the topic `Invitation to Canvas Course` to `peter.larsson-green@ju.se`.
