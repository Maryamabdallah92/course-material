# Tutorials
Here you'll find the source code written in the different tutorials. They will be published after respective tutorial.

::: warning Recordings
The links to the recordings of the tutorials are available on the Canvas page [Tutorial Recordings](https://ju.instructure.com/courses/2142/pages/tutorial-recordings). Since students are part of the recordings, I don't want to make them available to everyone on the web. By publishing the links on Canvas, only students taking the course will be able to see them. Please don't post the links anywhere on the web.

::: tip Git Commit History
Notice how beautiful and easy read the Git commit history is:

[https://github.com/PeppeL-G/wdf-example/commits/master](https://github.com/PeppeL-G/wdf-example/commits/master)

Always before coding, decide what the goal of your next should be!
