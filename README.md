This is a project for a Single-Page Application implemented in [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/) that I ([Peter Larsson-Green](https://ju.se/en/personinfo.html?sign=LarPet)) will use to share the course material in the courses I teach at [Jönköping University](https://ju.se/en.html). It is hosted here on GitHub using their static web hosting service [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).
