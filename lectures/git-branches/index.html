This is especially true when the repository only exists locally on your own computer, because then the repository only have a single branch (a default branch) called <em>master</em>, and you can more or less ignore the fact that branches exist in Git, even though you do work on the master branch all the time. But most often, this is not the case, and you need to have a basic understanding of how branches work in Git for you to use Git in best way possible. Furthermore, Linus Torvalds designed Git around the usage of branches, so they play a very central role in Git.</p> <h2 id="what-is-a-branch"><a href="#what-is-a-branch" class="header-anchor">#</a> What is a branch?</h2> <p>We usually use commits to remember earlier versions of the project, but we can also use commits to work on different versions of the project at the same time. This is the case when the repository does not consists of a single chain of commits. An example of that would be a repository consisting of the following commits:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 4                HEAD
                          ↓                      ↓ 
Commit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2      &lt;--      Commit 3
</code></pre></div><p>Here we can see that we have two different latest versions of the project represented by Commit 4 and Commit 3 respectively. They both contain features/functionalities the other version does not contain, and we say that we have two branches of the project at Commit 2. To know which version of the project we are working on, Git uses the HEAD pointer, so in this case we can see that we are currently working on the branch with Commit 3 (if we would create a new commit, that commit would point to Commit 3).</p> <p>So, a <em>branch</em> is simply a separate line of commits that takes the project in a different direction.</p> <p>By default, there exists a single branch called <code>master</code>, which usually is used for the &quot;main version&quot; of the project. As long as you don't create a new branch and switch to it, you always work on the <code>master</code> branch.</p> <p>In practice, a branch is just a pointer that points to the latest commit in that branch. The HEAD pointer in turn points to the branch you are currently working on.</p> <div class="custom-block warning"><p class="custom-block-title">Note</p> <p>To simplify, we previous said that HEAD pointed to the latest commit. This is wrong; HEAD points to the branch you are currently working on.</p></div> <p>A repository with a single branch (the <code>master</code> branch only) and two commits would look like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                        HEAD

                          ↓
Commit 1      &lt;--      Commit 2
</code></pre></div><p>Then when you create a new commit, the <code>master</code> branch pointer is changed to point to the newly created commit:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                               HEAD

</code></pre></div><h2 id="creating-branches"><a href="#creating-branches" class="header-anchor">#</a> Creating branches</h2> <p>It is possible to create a new branch using the command <code>git reset --hard XXX</code>, but Git have better support for working with branches through other commands that are better to use.</p> <p>The best way to create a new branch is by using the command <code>git branch BRANCH_NAME</code>. This create a new branch with the name <code>BRANCH_NAME</code> that points to the commit your current branch is pointing to. Note that this command only creates the branch, it does not switch to that branch, so we are still working on the same branch as we were on before.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Example</p> <p>If your repository looks like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                        HEAD

But why would you want that? In the end, you only want to have a single version of the project that contains all the features/functionalities, and not 5 different versions that each contains a fifth of all the functionalities, right?</p> <p>When you have two branches, you can merge the work you have done (the commits) in one of them into the other. You do that by creating a special type of commit called a <em>merge commit</em>. A merge commit is new commit that points to the latest commit in each of the two branches, so this new commit will contain the features/functionality from both branches.</p> <p>When you have created a merge commit, the commits in a repository can look like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                               HEAD

</code></pre></div><p>Commit 5 will now contain the features/functionality from both Commit 4 and Commit 3, and can now be seen as the single latest version of the project. Creating merge commits can be a little bit complicated (you can have conflicts (contradictive changes to the source code in the two different branches)) that you need to handle, but let's go through how to merge branches later. For now, it's enough for you to know that you can do it.</p> <p>But why use branches at all if we don't want to have them in the end? Turns out that branches are really useful during development. Especially when multiple programmers work on the same project at the same time, because a programmer don't want to be disturbed by commits from other programmers that might interfere with the programmer's own work before it is finished. So each programmer can create her own branch which the other programmers won't interfere with, and when the programmer is done with all of her work on that branch, she can share her work with the other programmers by merging it with the <code>master</code> branch. It can for example look like this (let's ignore the HEAD pointer, because it is not important in this example):</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                       Commit 3      &lt;--      Commit 6      &lt;--      ALICE BRANCH

For example, if you create a library, then you might want to have one branch for each major version of the library you have, so you conveniently can switch between them. This way, it is easy to fix bugs/security vulnerabilities in older versions of the library, and to add new features in the latest version of the library. Or maybe you just want to test something new which you don't know if you'll have any use of. Then you can do that work in a new branch, and if you later discover that it didn't play out well, you go back and work as usual on the <code>master</code> branch or your own branch.</p> <div class="custom-block tip"><p class="custom-block-title">Example</p> <p>A designer was given the task to improve the layout on a website (change the placement of menus, change the colors used, etc.).

In this case Git doesn't need to create an extra commit to merge the two branches, but will instead simply move the <code>master</code> branch pointer to the <code>alice</code> branch pointer, so the repository will look like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                                                      HEAD

Imagine our repository looks like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                        HEAD
                          ↓

The only sensible outcome of merging the two branches is to end up with both of the files, and Git understands that.</p> <p>So, to merge the <code>test</code> branch into the <code>master</code> branch we run the command <code>git merge test</code>. When we do that, Git will create a new merge commit (Commit 5) that contains both <code>master-file.txt</code> and <code>test-file.txt</code>, and our repository will look like this:</p> <div class="language- extra-class"><pre class="language-text"><code>                                               HEAD

Instead of creating a merge commit, this will rather copy the commits from one branch to other. The main benefit with this solution is that the history of a branch becomes much simpler: it will consist of a linear sequence of commits only, making it much easier to read. When you create merge commits, the history of a branch will not be a linear sequence, but rather a tree of commits, which can be a bit hard to interpret.</p> <h2 id="practising"><a href="#practising" class="header-anchor">#</a> Practising</h2> <p>Play around with <a href="http://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#free" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visualizing Git<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg></a> to learn how branches work.
